Use interactive video to sell your WooCommerce products


== Description ==
We added a whole new sales channel to WooCommerce: Video!

So now you can:


* Sell directly from within video
* Sell at the very moment your audience is inspired 
* Sell on any website!



With the help of this interactive video plugin your customer does not have to leave the video to:


* click on a product
* see the product description
* see the product photo’s
* choose size and colour
* add the product to the basket
* change quantity inside the basket
* click on checkout


after clicking on checkout, the cart-content will be ready for purchase inside the checkout of your WooCommerce shop


<strong>How it works:</strong>

We worked extremely hard to make this plugin as easy to use as possible. 

In the admin section you: 

1. add a video
2. choose the video dimensions
3. choose a player theme to match your branding
4. select 1 of your WooCommerce products from the dropdown
5. choose the position of the product and the cart
6. save the video
7. place your interactive video on any website

<strong>What kind of videos can be used:</strong>

As a source for your video you have a couple of options:


1. Self-hosted videos
2. Youtube videos
3. Vimeo videos


<strong>Distribution:</strong>

When the products are added to your interactive video and you’re happy with the look ‘n feel, the time has come to distribute your video. 

Now the cool thing is, your interactive video can be placed on most websites, so not just your own. That means you can have video-webshops conatining your products virtually everywhere.. 

The thumbrule for distribution is: If you can paste html code somewhere, you can probably also paste the video there because the interactive video is wrapped inside an Iframe

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Can i connect multiple shops to 1 account?<br>
At the moment you can’t, this option is ranking high on our roadmap though.. 

* I saw on your website you also offer other interactive tools, are they available from within the plugin?<br>
At the moment not, they will be in the future.. 

* Can I use the plugin without having an account?<br>
That is not possible as the actual magic is happening on our servers you need an account to establish a connection..
